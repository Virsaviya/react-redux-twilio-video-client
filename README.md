## Twilio-Video with React / Redux

This is a simple app that integrates [Twilio-Video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video) with React / Redux, more specifically, this [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate), which uses:
- ESNext
- React
- Redux
- Sagas
- Immutable.js
- Reselect
- Webpack
- styled-components

and lots of other buzz-words.  But mostly, it's a really solid, scalable, extensible boilerplate for those who are comfortable in the React / Redux ecosystem.

## To get started

Clone this repo, as well as the [server](https://github.com/Virsaviya/react-redux-twilio-video-server) (which is essentially a clone of the [twilio-video quick start](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-js)) and install all dependencies.  (Both projects use yarn, if you have that installed.  If not, npm works too.)

First, run the server: navigate to the server directory and run `node .`

In another terminal, navigate to this repo and run `npm run start:dev`
